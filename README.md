# Data Science Challenge 

## Classification Task

It was requested to build a model that correctly classify users based on their plan Standard | Paid.  
Exploratory Data Analysis, Outlier Detection, Feature Selection/Extraction/Engineering,Imbalance handling, Hyperparameter Tuning.  
### Models were evaluated based on the F1 score.

## User Modeling

Grouping users based on their most descriptive characteristics e.g. frequency of transactions, age group, total amount spent,  
currency type (Fiat | Cryptocurrency) etc

## Churn Detection (Unsupervised Learning Task)

### Detect unengaged and churned users

* Target metrics were defined to measure users engagement
* Heuristic approach using threshold
* Clustering approach utilizing K-Means algorithm
